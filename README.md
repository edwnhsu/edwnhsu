âš¡ Fun fact: 

Iâ€™m originally from Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ and love exploring data in creative waysâ€”whether it's for fun projects or real-world applications. I'm currently working towards settling in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, especially in Vancouver, where I can combine my passion for data with the vibrant lifestyle the city offers. Beyond data, Iâ€™m a big fan of Minecraft and love expressing myself through singing, diving into music and movies, and exploring nature through hiking. Vancouverâ€™s blend of outdoor beauty and urban life feels like the perfect place for these passions to thrive!
